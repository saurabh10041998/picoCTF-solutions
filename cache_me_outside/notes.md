3. glibc --> ptmalloc --> dlmalloc

### Why do people use heap ??
- Mannually allocate the new region during program execution. This is done via `malloc`.
- Then programmer can then interact with "allocations".
- After use it done, programmer can return the allocation back to heap manager using `free`. 


### Memory chunks and chunk allocation strategies

```
 Whatever amount request by programmer to heap manager, 
 1. Find the requested amount on heap
 2. store its metadata
 3. Ensure allocation is 8 byte aligned on 32 bit system, 16 byte aligned on 64 bit system

```

Request x byte --> metadata + x bytes + alignment byte 

return value from malloc = start address of x byte

### Chunk allocation : basic strategy.
